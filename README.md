# Bayesian Inference with Linear Models

## About This Project

Welcome to my portfolio showcase project: Bayesian Inference for Linear Models! This repository demonstrates my skills in implementing Bayesian inference techniques for linear regression models using various sets of basis functions.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have implemented the following tasks:

1. Implemented Bayesian inference algorithms for linear regression models.
2. Utilized different sets of basis functions to explore Bayesian linear models' predictive capabilities.
3. Analyzed and visualized predictive uncertainties to assess model performance.
4. Computed marginal likelihoods to evaluate model complexity and goodness of fit.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset `year-sunspots-republicans.csv` used for analysis.
- `scripts/`: Includes Python scripts for Bayesian inference on linear models and plot generation.
- `plots/`: Directory for storing generated plots illustrating data and model predictions.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Programming Languages**: Proficient in Python for data analysis and visualization.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Implemented Bayesian inference techniques for linear regression models.
- **Data Visualization**: Created informative plots to visualize data and model predictions.
- **Problem-Solving**: Analyzed model performance and evaluated different sets of basis functions.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed with required libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
3. Run the provided scripts to explore Bayesian inference on linear models with various basis functions.
4. Review the generated plots to gain insights into the predictive capabilities of Bayesian linear models.
